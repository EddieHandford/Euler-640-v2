# Euler-640-v2
Euler problem 640 , solved with a much smoother approach


This python code is designed to tackle the EULER 640 on https://projecteuler.net/

It is essentially trying to calculate the average game length using the optimal strategy.
The main challenge of this project is the run time, the majority of the work is to make this program run in a timely manner.

Due to the nature of this , it is lacking graphical outputs,
so I have included a screenshot of the function which outputs all possible dice states
